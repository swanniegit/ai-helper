-- Fix session RLS issue for custom authentication
-- The issue is that user_sessions table has RLS policies that use auth.uid()
-- but we're using custom JWT authentication, not Supabase Auth

-- Option 1: Disable RLS on user_sessions (quickest fix)
ALTER TABLE user_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: If you want to keep RLS, create a policy that allows all operations
-- (Uncomment the lines below if you prefer this approach)

-- DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own sessions" ON user_sessions;
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all session operations" ON user_sessions
--     FOR ALL
--     USING (true)
--     WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'user_sessions';

-- Test session creation
-- This should work now without RLS blocking the insert
