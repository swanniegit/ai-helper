Of course. Here is a revamped career progression framework in markdown format. This structure is designed to be easily parsed by an AI to determine skill tracks for both Oracle and PHP developers.

Developer Career Progression Framework
Plan Vision

To build high-performing development teams by establishing clear, measurable skillsets and providing structured career progression paths. This framework ensures consistency in hiring, evaluation, and professional development for both Oracle and PHP tracks.

Core Pillars

This plan is built on four core pillars to create a holistic development cycle:

Test & Assess: Defining methods to measure proficiency at each level, from hiring assessments to ongoing performance reviews.
Integrate & Promote: Outlining how skills are embedded into daily work and how growth is formally and informally recognized and rewarded.
Develop & Train: Identifying specific resources, activities, and training programs to actively build skills for current and future roles.
Track & Review: Establishing a system for monitoring individual progress against the defined skillsets, facilitating continuous feedback and development planning.
